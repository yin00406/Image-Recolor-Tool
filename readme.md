## üìñ How to Use

1. **Upload Image**: Click "Choose Image" and select the image you want to recolor
2. **Select Color**: Click on any color from the automatically detected color palette
3. **Adjust Target Color**:
   - **Hue (0-360)**: The color type (e.g., 0=red, 120=green, 240=blue)
   - **Saturation (0-100%)**: Color intensity (0=gray, 100=vivid)
   - **Value (0-100%)**: Brightness level (0=black, 100=bright)
4. **Set Color Tolerance (0-100)**: Controls how similar colors are matched for replacement
   - **Low tolerance (0-20)**: Only matches colors very close to the selected color (more precise, less coverage)
   - **Medium tolerance (20-50)**: Matches moderately similar colors (balanced approach)
   - **High tolerance (50-100)**: Matches a wide range of similar colors (less precise, more coverage)
   - **Tip**: Start with tolerance around 30 and adjust based on results. Increase if not enough pixels are recolored, decrease if too many unwanted pixels are affected.
5. **Apply**: Click "Apply Recolor" to see the result
6. **Download**: Save your recolored image as PNG
